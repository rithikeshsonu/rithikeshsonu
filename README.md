## **SUMMARY**

I’m a **.NET developer** with **4 years** of experience working with C#, **ASP.NET**, and a ton of tech that makes the digital world spin. From **monolithic** to **microservices**, I've seen it all. I write **clean code**, hunt down bugs like they’re my arch-nemesis, and generally spend my days crafting smooth, scalable apps. And I do all of this with a side of fun and plenty of caffeine ☕ (obviously).


## **WORK EXPERIENCE**

### **Sails Software Solutions** *(Apr '24 - Present)*  
Where the magic happens… aka **backend engineering heaven**:

- Developed **Web APIs** that power a bunch of apps, ensuring they run faster than a cheetah on Red Bull 🐆☕.
- **Cross-functional teamwork**: It's like a team sport, but with fewer balls and more code.
- I occasionally dabble in **front-end projects with Angular** – because who says back-end devs can't be **designers** too? 😉
- Implemented **JWT Bearer tokens and Auth0** for authentication and authorization – so secure, even Fort Knox would be jealous 🔐.
- Played with **Elasticsearch**, **Kafka**, **MySQL**, and **Azure**, and even got to feel like a cloud wizard ☁️.
- Migrated **deprecated Elasticsearch packages** to new ones, giving them a much-needed makeover 💅.
- Managed **Docker** deployments, because containers are basically like code in a box (that’s a good thing).
- Bug fixing? Let’s just say I don’t allow bugs in my code unless they’re **Easter eggs**. 🐞

### **NTT Data Information Processing Services** *(Feb '21 – Apr '24)*  
Where I fine-tuned my **SQL wizardry** and became a **C# superhero**:

- Designed and developed **single-page apps** with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **C#**, all while making sure the user experience was smoother than butter on a hot pan 🍞🧈.
- Optimized **SQL Server queries** (saving **60 minutes** of manual work daily) – turning slow queries into speed demons 🏎️.
- Created **stored procedures**, triggers, and views like a chef perfecting their secret sauce 🍲.
- Worked on **SQL performance tuning** – reducing lag, boosting efficiency, and making everything *faster* than a caffeine-fueled sprint 🏃‍♂️💨.
- Got involved in **production incident resolutions**, ensuring that the system stayed up, and issues stayed down (but not my spirits 😅).
- Took part in **Agile sprints** like an Olympic sprinter 🏅.

#### **Achievements**:  
- Played a pivotal role in a high-stakes **client meeting** with the CEO and 600 employees. Result? **Perfect client satisfaction** – smooth as silk ✨.
- Completed **75+ Behavioral Trainings** (because you can never have too many soft skills, right? 💼).

## **FUN FACTS**
